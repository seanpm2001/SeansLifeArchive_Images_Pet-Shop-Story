# Pet Shop Story session August 5th 2021

I had a normal session today and did the usual collection, although at a very slow rate. I remembered to request permits for expansion, I requested from everyone, just in case it would work. <!-- requested 4 permits for expansion, as it seems only the games default NPC was filling the requests, and I did an extra 3 out of habit. !-->

The game glitched out graphically today due to a schism when clicking on an ad by mistake. It doesn't affect the images too much, they are just further zoomed out (more than the game is designed to zoom out)

## Overview

See above.
