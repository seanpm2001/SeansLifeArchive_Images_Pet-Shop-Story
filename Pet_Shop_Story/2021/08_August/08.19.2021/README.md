# Pet Shop Story session August 19th 2021

I had a normal session today and did the usual collection, although at a very slow rate. I forgot to request permits for expansion again today. <!-- I requested from everyone, just in case it would work. !--> <!-- requested 4 permits for expansion, as it seems only the games default NPC was filling the requests, and I did an extra 3 out of habit. !-->

## Overview

See above.
