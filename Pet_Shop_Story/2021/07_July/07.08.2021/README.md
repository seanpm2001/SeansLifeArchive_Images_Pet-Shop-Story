# Pet Shop Story session July 8th 2021

I had a normal session today and did the usual collection. I also remembered to request 4 permits for expansion today, even though only the games NPC is giving them. I did 4 just out of habit. <!-- requested 4 permits for expansion, as it seems only the games default NPC was filling the requests, and I did an extra 3 out of habit. !-->

## Overview

See above.
