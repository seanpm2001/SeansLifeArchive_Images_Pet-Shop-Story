# Pet Shop Story session July 22nd 2021

I had a normal session today and did the usual collection. I remembered to request permits for expansion, I requested from everyone, just in case it would work. <!-- requested 4 permits for expansion, as it seems only the games default NPC was filling the requests, and I did an extra 3 out of habit. !-->

## Overview

See above.
