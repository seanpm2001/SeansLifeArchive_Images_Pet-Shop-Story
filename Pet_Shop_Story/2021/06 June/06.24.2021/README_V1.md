# Pet Shop Story session June 24th 2021

I had a normal session today and did the usual collection, and did not request any permits for expansion, as I forgot. <!-- requested 4 permits for expansion, as it seems only the games default NPC was filling the requests, and I did an extra 3 out of habit. !-->

## Overview

See above.
