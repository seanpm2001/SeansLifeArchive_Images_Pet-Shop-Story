# SeansLifeArchive_Images_Pet-Shop-Story
The module for my life story project that contains my Pet Shop Story gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all weekly Pet Shop Story session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamlava.petshop&hl=en&gl=US) there is a version available for iOS. It is listed below

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Pet Shop all the way back in 2012 and 2013. I started playing again in 2016 during my YouTube content creator phase, up to 2018, where I took a break. I came back to it again in 2020 a few times until it stuck near the end of the year.
